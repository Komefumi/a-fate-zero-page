# A New Model of Biological Research and Education

If you plan on pursuing an education in biology, you can expect to meet with three problems. Low returns, high investment, low independence. Each of these notions are problematic, enough to become a deciding factor in choosing alternative routes. There is sufficient reason to avoid pursuing higher education in Biological Sciences.

A framework for overcoming these challenges and subsequently, a way forward for humanity and the planet as a whole will be developed through this project.

Firstly, we will need to explore the problems. Develop understanding of them and revise our notions periodically.
